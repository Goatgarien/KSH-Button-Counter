# KSH-Button-Counter
Takes KSH file as input and counts how many times each button is hit within the chart. 
Can also count all ksh files within a folder,
give a total for all charts, 
give stats for which chart in the folder is most skewed towards each button,
and which charts use the most of a certain button out of any other chart.
